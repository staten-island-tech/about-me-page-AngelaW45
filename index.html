    <h2>Computer Science about me project</h2>
    <p>
      Hello! My name is Angela Wang, I’m currently a sophomore at Staten Island
      Technical Highschool. I’m 14 years old, turning 15 on October 17, 2007.
      Chances are, you might know another person called Angela Wang as well (yes
      we have the same exact name); no worries though because you’ll be able to
      tell us apart very easily since she has pink dyed hair, and I don’t. I’ll
      include the link to my school website in case you're interested in the
      school. Some fun facts about me are below!

    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        I enjoy drawing, I took realistic still life art classes in middle
        school
      </li>
      <li>
        Some classes I enjoy are coding and A/V / filming (casually of course),
        which found this out last year as a freshman when I had STEM and A/V
        class
      </li>
      <li>
        Some classes I currently take are Algebra 2, CAD, Badminton class for
        gym, AP computer science (obviously), and Physics
      </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      Now that we talked about the positive things I like, it’s time for the
      negative,
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Socializing is kinda hard- especially with strangers or teachers you
        don’t really know
      </li>
      <li>
        I’m terrible at tests, that’s a big red flag for life cause, school has
        a lot of tests so…
      </li>
      <li>
        I don’t like the first week back from school because my mind is in
        shambles trying to remember how to do literally everything (mostly
        Russian and math)
      </li>
    </ol>
